== NOTES ==
Still in early stages - try checking back later!

== Building your Plugin ==
* Update "_deploy/options.py" to reflect your projects namespacing
* Open a terminal and cd into the "_deploy" folder
* Run "python deploy.py"
*** This will rename variious classes and options to use your plugin's namespace
*** (Essentially it's doing a global find and replace for "template_" to "your_slug_" then moving a readme.txt file into the main plugin folder)
* Delete the _deploy folder
