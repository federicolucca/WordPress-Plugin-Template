== NOTES ==
This is meant to be a starting point for WordPress plugins with an emphasis on modular design.

== Features ==
* All files in the ./lib folder are included by the main plugin script
*** All reusable, or standardizable, code should live in ./lib
*** The stock version of this template does not contain a ./lib folder - it is intended that you should include the "WordPress Plugin Script Library" as a submodule here as follows:

	git submodule add git://github.com/jtrussell/WordPress-Plugin-Script-Library.git lib

***** Try to avoid bloating your main plugin script with function declarations
*** Library files - or classes with all static methods - should be prefixed with "lib-"
*** Proper class files should be prefixed with "class-"

== Getting your plugin ready ==
(Eventually there will be a configurable deploy script, but for now...)
* Do a global find/replace on "tempate_" for "your_plugin_slug_"
* Update _deploy/readme.txt and move it to the root directory
*** Delete the _deploy folder
* Update the static attributes at the top of lib/lib-wp.php to match your namespacing preferences
